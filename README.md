# Air Quality Analysis: A Comparative Study

## Introduction

Air quality is a critical environmental issue that affects public health, ecosystem balance, and the climate. Monitoring and analyzing air pollutants can provide valuable insights into the sources of pollution and the effectiveness of air quality regulations and measures. This notebook focuses on the analysis of air quality data from two distinct locations: Cambridge Roadside and Wicken Fen.

### Objectives

- **Data Handling**: Demonstrate how to load, clean, and prepare air quality data for analysis using Python and its powerful libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Compare the levels of specific air pollutants, including Nitric oxide (NO), Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and Nitrogen oxides expressed as nitrogen dioxide (NOx), between an urban roadside in Cambridge and a rural site at Wicken Fen.
- **Temporal Trends**: Explore how pollutant levels vary monthly and identify any significant trends or discrepancies between the two sites over the observed period.

### Data Description

The datasets contain measurements of various pollutants, recorded at two monitoring stations:
- **Cambridge Roadside**: Located in an urban setting, this station captures data relevant to traffic-related pollution.
- **Wicken Fen**: Situated in a rural area, this station helps understand background levels of pollutants, mostly unaffected by direct urban emissions.
